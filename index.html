            The first thing I did for this class was to watch some movies, yay! out of 
            the 4 recommended I chose Minority report and Iron man. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Minority Report, based on the Philip K Dick novel of the same name, 
            looked closely at the cultural implications of technology. What institutions 
            are built around technology? Who uses new drugs and how? Are decisions made 
            using only data fair and unbiased? 
            <br>
            <br>
            Iron man has some commentary on the military industrial complex but is more 
            interested in the physical realities of possible technology. How do we touch it? 
            What is it like to wear? How can it improve our physical capabilities?

          <p style="width: 200px;"> In class that week we started thinking about the web. What do websites currently 
            look like and how do we currently interact with them. To develop this we had an 
            exercise to sketch a site based off a randomly generated prompt.</p>
          <img class="contentImg" src="img/textPrompt.jpg" alt="Pencil sketch for a website"> 
          <p style="width: 200px;">I can’t remember our prompt exactly but it was something like; 
            <br> 
            <br>
            - A cloud based <br> 
            - To do list <br> 
            - For musicians
          </p>

          <br>
          <p style="width: 400px;"> Finally this week I played with html to produce a hello world sketch. I have tried 
            learning html once before and so had some familiarity with the concept of tags. 
            However I found html unwieldy. Using it felt like turning pre-determined settings on 
            and off. This made development slow and not very expressive. Building this sketch was 
            a re-introduction to html and a first time foray into CSS, exploring what can be done 
            in these languages.

            Week 2 began with a quick exercise of crazy eights to get us thinking about 
            how our website could look and function. Designs where meant to be fast and 
            rough to produce a variety of ideas. 
          </p>

          <p style="width: 400px;">
            After making these sketches we had to make a paper prototype of the website, 
            including some interactivity. The easy and carefree attitude I had from the crazy 
            eights vanished and I put way too much pressure on myself to create a design that 
            would be interesting visually and conceptually. To get around this and make 
            <i>something</i> I reworked one of the crazy eights ideas. A long thin centre line 
            that I found visually compelling.

            After class this week I started building the website in VS code. Having already 
            built the Hello World site made starting a new html document a lot less scary, even 
            if I still didn’t know how to make it look the way I wanted. I wasn’t in the habit 
            of taking screengrabs of when I started the site but it looked pretty rough. I also 
            had a million tabs open from googling “how to do &lt;blank&gt; in html/CSS”. It felt 
            like very slowly chipping away at a rock. Eventually I figured out how to link p5.js 
            to html with a coding train tutorial and got it looking like this. --&gt;
          </p>
          <img class="contentImg" src="img/Web_Dev1.png" alt="A work in progress version of this site">

          <br>
          <p style="width: 250px;">
            Indirect inspirations for this site come from Ryoji Ikeda and 
            Nonotak who’s work I adore. Both of their aesthetics feel tech heavy but I believe 
            that is a result of heavy use of geometry and systems rather than an obsession with 
            tech. 
          </p> 
          <img class="conceptImg" src="img/Ryoji_Ikeda.jpg" alt="A work by Ryoji Ikeda">
          <p style="width: 260px;">
            Both also examine interactions between music and light in 
            immersive installations (there is an interesting proposition, is immersion a form 
            interactivity?). Both also work almost exclusively in black and white which I find 
            to be almost a cliché of technology. 
          </p>
          <img class="conceptImg" src="img/Nonotak.jpg" alt="A work performance by Nonotak">
          <p style="width: 260px;">
            I deliberately wanted to avoid this black and white cliché by using colour. I didn’t know how until I 
            stumbled on these incredible images of the microscopic structures of alcohol. I 
            believe the background of this site is a close up of a pina colada. On the right is Bourbon.

            Before class this week I managed to steal some time to visit Execute_Photography at 
            the RMIT gallery. It was smaller than I expected but the works all had quite a bit 
            of depth. Several of the works were interactive if in quite different ways, and two 
            of the curators where present to introduce the exhibition and after giving some time 
            to view the works answer questions.

            It got me thinking about how people produce and 
            interact with photography on scale. Everyone making and sharing images via the 
            internet. Huge digital collections ripe for mining freely given. It’s democratic, 
            it’s been taken advantage of.

            In class this week the idea of responsive design was introduced. How will our 
            websites look on a phone or tablet vs a computer which most of us are designing 
            for. Resizing the window to phone proportions produced this --&gt;

            I made a couple quick sketches about how I might like the site to look like on 
            mobile. These also solved the problem of where/how to add the weekly content to the 
            site, as until then it was just the centre line.

            Feels Good Man is a documentary I found by accident that looks at how the character Pepe, 
            create by cartoonist Matt Furie, ended up on the list of international hate symbols. This character 
            was turned into various memes by the now notorious website 4chan and warped into a 
            character that represented their self-proclaimed losser-dom. People outside of 4chan 
            discovered Pepe and 4chan-ers retaliated by making the memes too offensive to be 
            appropriated. This creates a double bind, you can’t criticize the image for being 
            politically incorrect as ‘it’s just a joke, we don’t really mean it’ but also they do 
            really mean it. Trump runs for president of the USA and becomes the loser president to 
            ruin America for the online NEETs. The online trolling Pepe as a symbol facilitates is now 
            brought into real world politics. Pepe memes flood the media with shit and warp objective 
            truth. Somewhere around this point Pepe ends up on the list of hate symbols and their 
            creator Matt Furie is fighting desperately to get them back/off the list. The most effective 
            measure is to sue anyone using Pepe on commercial products such as on posters from the 
            channel Info Wars. Finally out of nowhere Pepe pops up as a symbol used by the protestors 
            for democracy in Hong Kong???

            It’s a fascinating and horrifying look at online culture and the influence of the 
            internet. How identities naturally form online and then reach back out into the 
            world. The internet isn’t separate to the physical world but is instead part of a 
            feedback loop involving it.

            I did a bit more work on the website, notably I started trying to add 
            content to the page. Because of this I had to change the layout to 
            fit longer blocks of text and have images at a reasonable size. 
            I’ve only got the one screengrab from this process because when I get 
            in the zone of coding I kind of forget to take them. Every change 
            seems minute and the website looks/functions essentially the same, so 
            I move on to the next problem that bugs me. Then when there’s 
            nothings left to bug me it’s 3hours later and I have a “finished 
            product” (for now) with development documented.

            Whilst we were advised to clearly plan this website and then try and create 
            that I find I’m not making sketches, instead working from a loose vision in 
            my head. It seems pretty clear to me so what makes it ‘loose’ is that I 
            often change it on implementation. If it’s not working visually or is 
            proving difficult to code I’ll change it something that actually works. 
            Yes I could forget my vision but I find if I focus on the same problem/process 
            I end up a the same answer.

            Youtube recommended me a 1hour lecture on the properties of paper and folding 
            and it was great. Incredibly dense with information but wonderfully in quickly 
            and visually expressing complicated mathematical ideas. I was really enjoyed 
            maths in high school and took the hardest maths class I could for my final 
            year. I’m glad I did it, and when it finished I knew I never needed to do maths 
            again. This lecture taps into all the stuff I find fascinating about maths 
            (beautiful closed systems that can explain the world around us) 
            explained in largely intuitive ways with interactive demonstrations. What I 
            would like to be able to do in this class is to visualise systems and give 
            people the ability to interact with them.
