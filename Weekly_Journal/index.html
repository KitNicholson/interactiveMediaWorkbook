            The first thing I did for this class was to watch some movies, yay! out of 
            the 4 recommended I chose Minority report and Iron man. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Minority Report, based on the Philip K Dick novel of the same name, 
            looked closely at the cultural implications of technology. What institutions 
            are built around technology? Who uses new drugs and how? Are decisions made 
            using only data fair and unbiased? 
            <br>
            <br>
            Iron man has some commentary on the military industrial complex but is more 
            interested in the physical realities of possible technology. How do we touch it? 
            What is it like to wear? How can it improve our physical capabilities?

          <p style="width: 200px;"> In class that week we started thinking about the web. What do websites currently 
            look like and how do we currently interact with them. To develop this we had an 
            exercise to sketch a site based off a randomly generated prompt.</p>

          <p style="width: 200px;">I can’t remember our prompt exactly but it was something like; 
            <br> 
            <br>
            - A cloud based <br> 
            - To do list <br> 
            - For musicians

          <p style="width: 400px;"> Finally this week I played with html to produce a hello world sketch. I have tried 
            learning html once before and so had some familiarity with the concept of tags. 
            However I found html unwieldy. Using it felt like turning pre-determined settings on 
            and off. This made development slow and not very expressive. Building this sketch was 
            a re-introduction to html and a first time foray into CSS, exploring what can be done 
            in these languages.

            Week 2 began with a quick exercise of crazy eights to get us thinking about 
            how our website could look and function. Designs where meant to be fast and 
            rough to produce a variety of ideas. 
          </p>

          <p style="width: 400px;">
            After making these sketches we had to make a paper prototype of the website, 
            including some interactivity. The easy and carefree attitude I had from the crazy 
            eights vanished and I put way too much pressure on myself to create a design that 
            would be interesting visually and conceptually. To get around this and make 
            <i>something</i> I reworked one of the crazy eights ideas. A long thin centre line 
            that I found visually compelling.

            After class this week I started building the website in VS code. Having already 
            built the Hello World site made starting a new html document a lot less scary, even 
            if I still didn’t know how to make it look the way I wanted. I wasn’t in the habit 
            of taking screengrabs of when I started the site but it looked pretty rough. I also 
            had a million tabs open from googling “how to do &lt;blank&gt; in html/CSS”. It felt 
            like very slowly chipping away at a rock. Eventually I figured out how to link p5.js 
            to html with a coding train tutorial and got it looking like this. --&gt;
          </p>

            Indirect inspirations for this site come from Ryoji Ikeda and 
            Nonotak who’s work I adore. Both of their aesthetics feel tech heavy but I believe 
            that is a result of heavy use of geometry and systems rather than an obsession with 
            tech.

          <p style="width: 260px;">
            Both also examine interactions between music and light in 
            immersive installations (there is an interesting proposition, is immersion a form 
            interactivity?). Both also work almost exclusively in black and white which I find 
            to be almost a cliché of technology.

          <p style="width: 260px;">
            I deliberately wanted to avoid this black and white cliché by using colour. I didn’t know how until I 
            stumbled on these incredible images of the microscopic structures of alcohol. I 
            believe the background of this site is a close up of a pina colada. On the right is Bourbon.

            Before class this week I managed to steal some time to visit Execute_Photography at 
            the RMIT gallery. It was smaller than I expected but the works all had quite a bit 
            of depth. Several of the works were interactive if in quite different ways, and two 
            of the curators where present to introduce the exhibition and after giving some time 
            to view the works answer questions.

            It got me thinking about how people produce and 
            interact with photography on scale. Everyone making and sharing images via the 
            internet. Huge digital collections ripe for mining freely given. It’s democratic, 
            it’s been taken advantage of. <a href="https://photo.org.au/events/execute_photography/" target="_blank"> Link to the exhibition site</a>

            In class this week the idea of responsive design was introduced. How will our 
            websites look on a phone or tablet vs a computer which most of us are designing 
            for. Resizing the window to phone proportions produced this --&gt;

            I made a couple quick sketches about how I might like the site to look like on 
            mobile. These also solved the problem of where/how to add the weekly content to the 
            site, as until then it was just the centre line.

            Feels Good Man is a documentary I found by accident that looks at how the character Pepe, 
            create by cartoonist Matt Furie, ended up on the list of international hate symbols. This character 
            was turned into various memes by the now notorious website 4chan and warped into a 
            character that represented their self-proclaimed losser-dom. People outside of 4chan 
            discovered Pepe and 4chan-ers retaliated by making the memes too offensive to be 
            appropriated. This creates a double bind, you can’t criticize the image for being 
            politically incorrect as ‘it’s just a joke, we don’t really mean it’ but also they do 
            really mean it. Trump runs for president of the USA and becomes the loser president to 
            ruin America for the online NEETs. The online trolling Pepe as a symbol facilitates is now 
            brought into real world politics. Pepe memes flood the media with shit and warp objective 
            truth. Somewhere around this point Pepe ends up on the list of hate symbols and their 
            creator Matt Furie is fighting desperately to get them back/off the list. The most effective 
            measure is to sue anyone using Pepe on commercial products such as on posters from the 
            channel Info Wars. Finally out of nowhere Pepe pops up as a symbol used by the protestors 
            for democracy in Hong Kong???

            It’s a fascinating and horrifying look at online culture and the influence of the 
            internet. How identities naturally form online and then reach back out into the 
            world. The internet isn’t separate to the physical world but is instead part of a 
            feedback loop involving it.

            I did a bit more work on the website, notably I started trying to add 
            content to the page. Because of this I had to change the layout to 
            fit longer blocks of text and have images at a reasonable size. 
            I’ve only got the one screengrab from this process because when I get 
            in the zone of coding I kind of forget to take them. Every change 
            seems minute and the website looks/functions essentially the same, so 
            I move on to the next problem that bugs me. Then when there’s 
            nothings left to bug me it’s 3hours later and I have a “finished 
            product” (for now) with development documented.

            Whilst we were advised to clearly plan this website and then try and create 
            that I find I’m not making sketches, instead working from a loose vision in 
            my head. It seems pretty clear to me so what makes it ‘loose’ is that I 
            often change it on implementation. If it’s not working visually or is 
            proving difficult to code I’ll change it something that actually works. 
            Yes I could forget my vision but I find if I focus on the same problem/process 
            I end up a the same answer.

            Youtube recommended me a 1hour lecture on the properties of paper and folding 
            and it was great. Incredibly dense with information but wonderfully in quickly 
            and visually expressing complicated mathematical ideas. I was really enjoyed 
            maths in high school and took the hardest maths class I could for my final 
            year. I’m glad I did it, and when it finished I knew I never needed to do maths 
            again. This lecture taps into all the stuff I find fascinating about maths 
            (beautiful closed systems that can explain the world around us) 
            explained in largely intuitive ways with interactive demonstrations. What I 
            would like to be able to do in this class is to visualise systems and give 
            people the ability to interact with them. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p02DtmyQhU"target=“_blank”> Link to the lecture here </a>

          <p style="width: 300px;">Class this week was an introduction to generative art, and p5.js. We 
            looked at artists who had use generative ideas or processes in their work before computers; 
            Yoko Ono, Piet Mondrian, Sol Lewitt, and Vera Molnar. Despite this class being very tech

            concerns of technology have much broader implications.

          <p style="width: 300px;">After getting the conceptual foundation the class become a p5.js 
            tutorial. I already have experience in p5.js so I used the time to try to create Sol Lewitt’s 
            50 points within it. And then I wanted to make it interactive because this class is about 
            interaction after all.

            Randomness was heavily emphasized during this class. That systems can use chance. That 
            algorithms can be unpredictable. In an exercise to illustrate this in pairs we wrote a series 
            of rules that would interpret dice rolls into shapes. And then we would manually draw the 
            shapes on paper from the outcome of the dice rolls. I found this process extremally tedious. 
            One iteration took minutes, where doing the same thing in p5.js would take seconds.

            I was watching my dad read the newspaper over lunch and realised that ‘reading the newspaper’ is the same verb as 
            ‘browsing the internet’. This radically new form of media is still providing for existing needs and human behaviours. 
            In reading the paper one can find news articles yes, but also opinions pieces (blogs), film and tv reviews, what’s on 
            lists, cooking recipes, jokes and cartoons, horoscopes and puzzles of crosswords and sudoku. All of these have migrated 
            to the internet. The method of browsing the paper is also the same of browsing the internet. Exploring an unknown 
            collection of content to stay up to date, but mainly for recreation.

            Part of the homework this week was to draw a face in p5.js using text. I’ve 
            already done this, so I wanted to try and push it one step further. First 
            thought was to make something that would let you draw the face. A live video 
            feed that you could trace with text characters. Position controlled by mouse, 
            up and down controlling size, left right rotation. Click to save. What I 
            realised was that if there’s live video, you can have machine learning identify 
            the face, and then you can have it automatically draw the text elements on the 
            face. So I made that with ML5.js.

          <p style="width: 200px;">
            Easy part was getting the face mesh, that was provided by ML5.js. The hard 
            bit was manually positioning the text elements relative to the face mesh.

            Week 5 was heavily focused on computer vision. How are images collected, processed and 
            represented by technology. While there were some wonderfully creepy and unsettling artworks 
            in the lecture material seeing the commercial abuse of imagery was far more terrifying. Ai 
            powered phrenology by <a href="https://www.faception.com/" target=“_blank”> Faception </a> is 
            a particularly egregious example. While unlikely to be a direct response.

            The practical competent of class continued on computer vision by introducing how to use 
            images and live video in p5.js. I have not used either of these widely so it was a useful 
            starting point. In class we got to a point that made this mess texture using a slit screen 
            like effect, and then at home I played with different blend modes on video getting to some 
            pretty intense styles.

            From class feedback on our websites so far I assumed that I would need to find a way to 
            make images bigger. I didn’t just want to make this centre bar bigger because I felt it 
            would change the site for the worse. Somethings looked good on it, others not so much.

          <p style="width: 250px;">
            I tried making images switch to absolute positioning on hover, but this lead to a very 
            distracting glitch. If the mouse hovered over the image position but not the enlarged image 
            position it would flash very violently between the two.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 200px;">
            The solution was to make an onclick function to switch positioning. This still has bugs but 
            they can be navigated (and I kinda like them).

          <p style="width: 270px;">
            I also changed the website background to a p5 sketch that was made for another subject, but 
            was not included in the final submission. This was done on class feedback about image 
            attribution as the background image was something I had ‘borrowed’ from the internet. 
            While it probably wasn’t a problem as this is student work, I felt a bit iffy using an 
            image I did not have the rights to as a central element.

            I kept exploring using video in p5 at the start of this week. Specifically I wanted to 
            try and recreate work by Daniel Crooks using live video footage. Their work investigates time and space by heavily altering the way footage is recorded 
            and displayed. <a href="https://annaschwartzgallery.com/artist/daniel-crooks" target=“_blank”> Link to their work here</a>

            The two things I needed to know to make this kind of work were to find a way to crop live video, 
            and also to store each frame for latter recall. A video by The Coding Train on how to create live 
            slit-scan images introduced me to the copy() function. Allowing me to slice up an image into 
            distinct section, and to rearrange them however I liked.
          </p>

          <p style="width: 180px;">
            Using this function I made a sketch where only one row at a time would update. To create a normal 
            image with it you have to stay perfectly still, as any movement distorts the image like in early 
            photography.
          </p>
          <img class="contentImg" id="w6i4" onclick="toggleImageSize('w6i4')" src="img/w6_scan.png" title="p5-sketch; Semi-slitscan">
          <p style="width: 320px;">
            Finding a way to save live frames was a bit harder than I expected. My first attempt at 
            just passing the capture image into an array didn’t work, as every image in the array was 
            the live image. The solution was from another Coding Train tutorial on creating a 
            photobooth out of p5. In it they explain the reason just passing the capture DOM element 
            doesn’t work. Which I don’t understand as I still have no clue what a DOM element is. 
            However the video presents the get() function as a working alternative. With get() and 
            copy() I was able to recreate Daniel Crook’s work with live video, which was a lot of 
            fun to play with.

            This week’s class was on data. Ways meaning is both inherit in it, and how meaning can be
             extracted from it. How data is actually treated in data farms and the stories data can tell. 
             There was a large class activity where we all emptied out bags and pockets, and had to find 
             meaning in the contents.

            As groups we then collated all the stuff from our bags and had to find a way to arrange it all. 
            We arranged it,

            This activity took up much of the class, meaning much of the PowerPoint for this week was 
            skipped. Looking through it now there is so much cool stuff in it that I just don’t have 
            time to look at now T_T. Particular the live data sources. I might be coming back to the 
            content for this subject over the semester break….

            The reason I had no time for anything this semester was because I was operating sound and AV for 
            a student theatre show. They where both controlled by Qlab, software that reduces the complexity 
            of controlling multiple speakers and projectors down to pressing spacebar. For every cue in the 
            show, press the  space bar, and the appropriate actions will occur. Want a sound file to start? 
            Press space bar. Want to stop a sound file? Press space bar. Want to stop one sound file, start 
            another, and change the projection? Press space bar. So long as you set up the file correctly….. 
            <br> <br> Reducing the interface for control down to a single button created it’s own kind of stress.

            The last bits of time I had for this week where spent on tidying up this website 
            for submission. Adding a page for the p5 sketches took the most time. I wanted the 
            layout to match this page, but on clicking a button the background would change to 
            the relevant p5 sketch. The first attempt was to load them all in and use 
            ‘display-style: none’ to hide sketches. This didn’t work and just made the entire 
            canvas disappear entirely. 
          </p>
          <img class="contentImg" id="w6i12" onclick="toggleImageSize('w6i12')" src="img/w6_webDev.gif" title="Website Development">
          <p style="width: 450px;">
            I then went on a Jquery/AJAX wild goose chase trying to load in the scripts 
            dynamically. This should have worked but for some reason when loading in the code 
            this way it didn’t recognise/include any of the p5 functionality. It would run the 
            JavaScript fine but unless setup() and draw() where explicitly called they would 
            not run. I had considered using iframes with ‘display-style: none’ but it just 
            seemed messy in my head.
            <br><br>
            Hours later I noticed the src attribute. I come across Jquery code that would 
            change this attribute. I could have one iframe and simply change which html script 
             it was displaying. In the end I didn’t even need Jquery to change the src.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 250px;">
            Other changes to the site where less drastic, adding titles to images, a favicon and 
            checking links worked. I edited the p5 sketches to use the full window width, and also 
            to sit in the middle of the screen. This did break some of the sketches until I fixed 
            them, but some of these ‘broken’ versions looked quite good.

            The other major change was to add a landing page. I wanted to be able to link to the 
            research journal from the workbook (now called weekly journal) but still store it’s html 
            and images in a separate folder. Github’s requirement to have a index.html in the first 
            level of the repo made this difficult. Without the landing page there would be a workbook 
            folder and a research journal folder but no index.html. I actually quite like having the 
            landing page now. It clues in the viewer that the aesthetics of the site are one of it’s 
            focuses.
