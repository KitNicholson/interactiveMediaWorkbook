leftDoubleImage,Ryoji Ikeda,"Artist, Composer","Systems comprise the basis of their work. These can be expressed visually in large scale works or through their musical compositions. However as the audience we do not get to see the systems that power the works, just an impression of interconnecting pieces. My brain hooks onto these patterns, trying puzzle out or predict what has been deliberately withheld. Aesthetically the works are restrained, using a limited pallet and set of elements, however they build on each other into a grand scale that is very maximalist. The aesthetic leans heavily into cliches of technology, most of the sounds are beeps, chirps and hums that emanate from digital devices. Visually this is appears with extensive use of lines to build more complex shapes and the binary like white/black pallet, where points of red occasionally appear for emphasis. Ikeda was a strong reference point visually in building my website for 2a. But I wanted to try push this tech aesthetic a bit beyond it’s cliché by using colour expressively.",img/RI1.png,img/RI2.png,Supersymmetry at Mona,Supersymmetry at Mona,https://www.ryojiikeda.com/,"Immersive Experiences, Light, Data, Music", 
leftDoubleImage,Nonotak,Art Duo,"A heavy inspiration for my website design was the duo Nonotak Studio, comprised of Noemi Schipfer and Takami Nakamoto. Both their installation work and live performances seem driven between the interactions of sound, light and space. The movement of light and projection is emphasised by clicks and ambient drones, or it could be said that the sound is visualised in light. Whichever it is, both then interact with the physical space, bouncing off walls and around objects. Visually Nonotak use simple shapes, mostly rectangles and lines, which they combine into much more complex rhythms. I played off the visual aspects of their work, but looking back it is clear that there is so much that could have been explored using their sound design for web interactions.",img/NT1.jpg,img/NT2.jpg,_SHIRO,_SATELLITES,https://nonotak.com/,"Immersive Experiences, Light, Sound Design, Live Performance",
left,Sophie Rose,"Artist, Musician, Researcher","GLVD is a wearable device built by Sophie Rose to be used as a tool for live performance. According to her it came from exploring ways to control effects during live performance that would untether her from the computer. The surprising element to me is in how she describes the device enhancing her embodiment of the music. Something that makes more obvious the connection between mind and body. While everything that can be done with GLVD could be done with pressing buttons on computer the experience is entirely different, as is it’s appearance in performance. Seeing an electronic artist standing behind a table, twisting nobs and dials is an entirely different affect to seeing Rose twisting her body to alter sound.",img/SR1.png,,‘Enough’ Live at Three Phase Rehearsal Studios,,Personal site: https://www.sophiemusicrose.com/ | Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@sophiemusicrose,"Music, Technology, Wearables, Research, Live Performance",
leftDoubleImage,Look Mum No Computer,"Musician, Engineer","I adore the absolute batsh*t energy Sam Battle, known online as Look Mum No Computer, puts into their creations. They’re like a modern mad scientist for sound, truly embodying a D.I.Y approach and creating nonsensical inventions. These range from the benign (Teletubby Tidal Wave) to the mad (Furby Organ) and the dangerous (a flame throwing vacuum cleaner called Henry). All these projects are documented via an online site with information about the physical components and/or the related code for it. For their music making they have a giant modular synth rack the size of a fridge, that looks like a prop from a 1950s sci fi film. The number of dials, buttons, and cables on it seem beyond comprehension. The whole thing looks more like a code breaking device used in world war 2 than a machine that is used to make music.",img/LMNC1.jpg,img/LMNC2.jpg,Look Mum No Computer,Furby Organ,https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/,"Music, Technology, Synthesiser, Furbys, Flame Throwers",
left,Simone Giertz,"Engineer, Maker","I first encountered Simone Giertz on Youtube as the self-titled ‘Queen of Sh*ty Robots’. She made short Youtube videos where she would turn a dumb idea into a barely functional robot. Then somewhere along the way it turned from barely functional robots into fully functional products. The creative ideas stayed but it’s hard to call them ‘dumb’ now they result in useful and functional creations, most of the time. While Giertz has moved from humble beginnings to confident success, it’s the early stages of her Youtube channel that I find most inspiring. It’s rare to see someone so openly document and even celebrate their failures.",img/SG1.jpg,,Simone Geirtz demonstrating the 'Toothbrush Machine' at a TED talk,,https://www.simonegiertz.com/,"Robotics, Technology, Production",
left,Manfred Mohr,Artist,"One of the earliest people to work with computer generated imagery was Manfred Mohr. Their film ‘Cubic Limit’ was made in 1973-1974 and required months of intense labour to create. Every frame generated by the algorithm was drawn onto a high-resolution screen. An attached camera would then automatically capture the image into Celluloid, which was then contact copied onto film to create the animation. Now software like p5 generates and displays each frame near instantaneously. The work made by Mohr’s algorithms always feel a little like technical drawings. They do create beautiful graphics but that seems secondary to the information these graphics express. This stands out more in the animated videos, where the systematic movement gives a sense of purpose to the images. When the images are still, it is easier to see them as just abstract forms and forget the system behind their construction.",img/MM1.webp,,"Cubic Limit 2, P197-F, Plotter drawing on paper",,http://www.emohr.com/,"Algorithmic Art, Higher Dimensions",
leftDoubleImage,Daniel Crooks,Video Artist,"Time and space are dissected in the work by Daniel Crooks. Video is cut up into fragments of time and rearranged in ways that turn people into blobby, multi-dimensional beings, which wobble into and out of perceivable existence. To achieve this effect a series of rules are followed to transform regular video. The complexity of these rules vary from piece to piece. Some I believe I could reverse engineer from the final work, but other seem inscrutable. Most of my exploration in p5 was driven by trying to turn these rules into algorithms that could be used on live video. Crook’s video work tells wonderful stories using footage that is pre-recorded. I wanted to know what it would be like to be the subject of his work. To directly engage with alternate expressions of time and see the results instantly.",img/DC1.jpg,img/DC2.png,Portrait,Seek stillness in movement,https://annaschwartzgallery.com/artist/daniel-crooks,"Video Art, Time, Perception",
left,Owen Pallet,Musician,"The germ for my final project came from seeing a recorded performance by Owen Pallet. Using loops recorded live and his violin Pallet was able to perform an entire piece by themselves. I’d seen this technology used commonly with guitars and heard of the genre ‘Shoegaze’. So titled because performers would spend most of the time staring at their feet while using pedals to manipulate sounds. Seeing this used on a Violin made me both curios and envious to explore what could be done with such effects on a mic’d Viola. For most of classical music there must be multiple performers to build a chord or achieve harmony. The soloist has the orchestra behind them, as accompaniment, or else they’ll be playing something purely melodic. With looping, solo performers are now able to achieve and create harmonies by themselves. While this could be read as narcissistic and isolating, I believe this to liberating.",img/OP1.jpg,,Owen Pallet performing at Hillside festival,,https://www.owenpalletteternal.com/,"Music, Solo performance, Looping",
left,Adam Harvey Studio,"Art Activist, Researcher","As surveillance technology gets more sophisticated and increasingly present online, how do you resist ending up in a data set without giving consent? The work from Adam Harvey Studio provides responses on how to do just this, in ways that are often low-fi and easily replicable. ‘CV Dazzel’ created a look book of styles that would disguise the wearer from facial recognition using just makeup, hair styles and accessories. ‘Off Pocket’ was a tiny faraday cage just for your phone to prevent any kind of tracking from it. There are many artworks that comment on increasing surveillance, but speculate about future scenarios. Getting the viewer to think and question what might happen. Adam Harvey Studio creates tangible solutions that can be used right now, in response to existing privacy issues. They also engaging in research, document the non-consensual collection of data to power ai in their project ‘Exposing Ai’. Learning the effort put in to covertly collecting faces for machine learning to gobble up is both engaging and mildly horrifying.",img/AHS1.png,,"Think Privacy Poster Series: Fuck My Like, 2018",,https://adam.harvey.studio/,"Privacy, Ai, Online Data, Political, Research",

The interaction between visuals and sound is at the core of most of their work. Their installations pulse with heavy drones and sharp ticks that complement sharp lighting changes. They have also created systems for interpreting music visually that are capable of incredible variety. I can’t for the life of me interpret how they function. They fluctuate between organic amorphous blobs and rigid defined shapes, moving with a slow hypnotic pulse.",img/404z1.png,img/404z2.png,No Time. No Future. I'm here.

leftDoubleImage,Sun Yuan and Peng Yu,Art Duo,"A common criticism of conceptual art is that lazy and without meaning, that it is unnecessarily obtuse and difficult to grasp. The work by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu is neither of these. Their attention to detail for each work provides so many clues and points of data for the viewer to start thinking about their work. The physicality of the work as well demands an emotional responsive from the audience. These are spectacles of art pieces. Technology is used in some of their works. sometimes as the focus and other times as just a piece of the construction. ‘Can’t Help Myself’ centres around the agency of a robot. It has a prescribed task but when that is completed it is allowed to dance. Would robots be more effective with spare time, and what would they do with it? ‘Old People’s Home’ is a hilarious work where life like sculptures of old men dressed in formal clothing are driven around in motorised wheel chairs. It’s a stab at ineffective social structures, the position/power these formally dressed figure is wasted as they bumble around blindly. The technology used is hidden away, but adds more comedy to the work.",img/SYPY1.jpg,img/SYPY2.jpg,If Seeing is not An Option,Old People's Home,http://www.sunyuanpengyu.com/,"Conceptual Art, Large Scale Work, Audience Engagement",
